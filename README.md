- **Java 21** - Java version
- **Spring Boot 3.5.3** - For rapid application development
- **Spring MVC** - Web framework for handling HTTP requests
- **Spring Data JDBC** - For database operations
- **Spring Boot Thymeleaf** - Template engine for server-side rendering
- **H2 Database** - In-memory database for development and testing
 
**Build & Run:**
```
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
```
App will be available at:
ðŸ”— http://localhost:8080/
### 2. Features

## ðŸ›  Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
- Controller tests using standalone setup with Mockito mocks
- Service layer tests with mocked repositories
- Fast execution without Spring context initialization

### Integration Tests
- Full Spring context tests for verifying component integration
- Database integration tests with H2 in-memory database
- End-to-end flow verification

### Test Coverage
Use IntelliJ IDEA's built-in code coverage tool:
1. Right-click on test class or package
2. Select "Run with Coverage"
3. View coverage results in the Coverage tool window

To go beyond coverage targets:
- Controllers: 80%+
- Services: 90%+
- Repositories: 85%+

## Configuration Profiles

- **dev** - Development configuration with H2 in-memory database
- **test** - Test configuration with separate H2 database
- **prod** - Production configuration with external database
